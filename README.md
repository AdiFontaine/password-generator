# Password Generator

This project's task was to create a randomized Password Generator utilizing existing HTML and CSS code, along with partially completed JavaScript. I wanted to approach it in a clean way, utilizing arrays for the user options surrounding the composition of their random passwords, and creating "while" loops that allow for multiple attempts by the user that are not valid.

By isolating the function regarding length of password from the function of character options, it made a slightly cleaner code as well in the case of any console log errors that could be encountered.
